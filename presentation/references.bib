abstract = {A series of localised blast loading experiments are performed in order to understand how the experimental set-up influences the impulse imparted to a plate. The imparted impulse is measured using a ballistic pendulum. The experimental results show that for both rigid and deformable plates the impulse measured by a ballistic pendulum increases as the height of the boundary (clamps) increases. Significantly, it is found that although the measured impulse varies as a function of the boundary height, the plate deformation is unchanged. This suggests that not all of the impulse measured by the ballistic pendulum resulted in plate deformation. Therefore, in numerical and analytical modelling, the total impulse from the ballistic pendulum should not simply be applied as a centrally localised pressure load. Numerical simulations of localised blast loading in combination with the aforementioned experimental results are used to develop a localised blast loading model. The loading model is a simplified pressure loading model which only imparts the deformation causing impulse as opposed to the total ballistic pendulum impulse. The model is validated using an independent set of localised blast load experiments on clamped mild steel plates. Results obtained using a published localised blast load model are also compared.}

abstract = {The methodology of computer simulations of crystal growth is described. Two main methods, kinetic Monte Carlo and molecular dynamics, are discussed. The principle of kinetic Monte Carlo simulations is explained in detail, including recent developments of algorithms. Particular attention is paid to approximations which are made in the construction of discrete growth models. Applications of the Monte Carlo method for three different kind of problems: kinetic roughening, near equilibrium growth, and far-from-equilibrium molecular beam epitaxy growth are presented together with examples of representative results. Possibilities of employing molecular dynamics simulations are discussed as well, and examples of results are also given. The range of applicability of different methods on present-day computers is evaluated.}

    abstract = "{Dropstones in lacustrine and marine sediments show a wide range of sizes: from less than a millimeter to many meters. Their size and shape determine the velocity and the acceleration when they settle through the water column, and this, in turn, determines in principle the imprint that they make in the bottom sediment. Although these parameters are crucial for dropstone deposition, the unknown material (sediment) properties (like strength, porosity, pore-water content, viscosity, etc.) of the bottom sediment play a just as important role in this process as the water depth, which can physically be understood as the length of the pathway traveled vertically through a dense medium before the impact. Reconstruction of the principal environmental conditions at the time of dropstone fall and deposition consequently requires considering the variety of factors affecting the final imprint depth of a dropstone, the combination of several numerical methods.Here, we show the results of numerical modeling of dropstones with different sizes that settle through water columns with different depths. Our results show how environmental factors control the deformation structures formed at the sedimentary surface during the impact of a dropstone, and how deep the imprint caused by the settling dropstone will be.}",

TITLE = {Numerical Simulation of Low Salinity Water Flooding on Core Samples for an Oil Reservoir in the Nam Con Son Basin, Vietnam},

ABSTRACT = {Low-salinity water flooding (LSWF) is environment-friendly and operates similarly to conventional waterflooding without the need for synthetic chemical materials. The application of LSWF makes sense in Vietnam as HC production has steadily declined since 2002, and the majority of main oil fields have become near mature and mature fields. In the next years, Enhanced Oil Recovery (EOR) should be a top priority for Petro Vietnam to boost its oil production, for which the key issue is how to select a suitable EOR technology. In this study, LSWF of the Lower Miocene sand using low salinity water from Lower Oligocene sand was investigated. Previously at the Ruby field in the Cuu Long Basin, an LSWF feasibility study was carried out based on a conventional core flooding experiment, which is time-consuming and costly. This study targets the Chim Sao field in the Nam Con Son Basin, for which a cheaper and faster assessing method is required. As a result, a numerical code written in Matlab was developed and successfully validated with the core flooding experiment results obtained at the Ruby field. The LSWF simulation was conducted using the multiple ion-exchange mechanisms (MIE), and the results obtained showed an increase in the oil recovery factor by 2.19% for the Lower Miocene Sand. Another important outcome of this study is the innovative proposal and successful simulation to use the abundant low salinity water from the underlying Lower Oligocene sand as a natural LSW source to inject into the Lower Miocene oil reservoir that can be a decisive factor to help apply LSWF in practice on a wide scale not only for Chim Sao but also other similar oil fields in southern offshore Vietnam.},

abstract = {An eco-hydraulic model was used to determine the levels of fish habitat suitability in the fluvial and lacustrine regions of a new Eco-City. This model has been developed by combining a depth integrated hydrodynamic and water quality model with a habitat suitability index model. Carps were selected as the target species because they represent the major fish population in the study area. Water depth, flow velocity and dissolved oxygen (DO) were used as the suitability indicators. Hydrologic data recorded during 2001–2010 were analysed to determine the base flow, average flow and high flow rates, which were used to represent the discharges in the river for the three stages of the carp life cycle: overwintering, spawning and growth, respectively. Numerical model simulations were undertaken to determine the levels of habitat suitability for carps to live at these three life stages. The model results indicate that under the current flow regime the habitat suitability level in the lacustrine region is too low for carps at the growth and overwintering stages. DO depletion, overriding the role of velocity and depth, is attributed to the poorly suited habitat conditions in the lacustrine region. To improve the suitability conditions in the lacustrine region, a DO enhancement scheme was used. Model results show that the scheme has significantly enhanced the water quality, with the ideally suited area increased from 24.4% to 67.9% for the overwintering stage and from 44.5% to 77.5% for the growth stage. Due to the high flow requirement for carps to spawn in the fluvial region, further numerical model simulations were undertaken to investigate the effect of flow augmentation on the carp spawning habitat suitability. Non-traditional water obtained from recycled domestic and industrial wastewater in the Eco-City was used as an additional water resource. The analysis indicates that the Eco-City has sufficient non-traditional water to meet the high flow requirement for carps to spawn in the fluvial region.}

    abstract = { New data from core samples are presented on organic matter accumulation during the last 10 000–15 000 years in six tropical African lakes. Pyrolysis and maceral studies indicate that in most of these lakes the preserved organic matter is a mixture of phytoplankton and higher plant remains showing varying degrees of bacterial degradation. Organic assemblages dominated by phytoplankton material have not been encountered. Sediments with the richest oil potential accumulate in meromictic or monomictic lakes during periods when the climate is humid and surface winds are relatively slack. The evidence from tropical Africa does not support current theories that shallow saline lakes may be especially favourable sites for the accumulation of oil prone sediment. }
