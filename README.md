# ALAGO2023
Publication work at the ALAGO 2023 congress

## Content
In this publication, we will be discussing a new model that has been developed to predict TOC levels in tropical lakes. Our focus will be on providing accurate and reliable data, based on the compiled information we have gathered. This model utilizes a stochastic approach, which takes into consideration the various factors that can impact TOC levels, such as weather conditions, water flow, and biological activity. By using this model, we hope to provide a valuable tool for researchers and environmentalists who are interested in monitoring and managing the health of tropical lakes.
